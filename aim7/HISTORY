12/14/2001:
Initial GPL release. This is "AIM Multiuser Benchmark - Suite VII Version 1.1"
repackaged and modified as follows:

- added an electronic version of the supporting documentation.
- repackaged "fakeh.tar" under the "ustar" (POSIX-compliant) format with
  GNU cpio.
- replaced references to gets() by calls to fgets() to circumvent the
  warning issued by GNU ld.
- applied GNU indent to all source files.
- removed un-necessary 'break' statements from 'case' constructs in some of the
  shell scripts.
- updated copyright notices so as to reflect the ownership by Caldera
  International, Inc.
