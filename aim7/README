                            AIM Multiuser Benchmark

OVERVIEW
The AIM Multiuser Benchmark - Suite VII tests and measures the performance of
Open System multiuser computers. Multiuser computer environments typically have
the following general characteristics in common: 

- A large number of tasks are run concurrently 
- Disk storage increases dramatically as the number of users increase. 
- Complex numerically intense applications are performed infrequently 
- An important amount of time is spent sorting and searching through large
  amounts of data. 
- After data is used it is placed back on disk because it is a shared resource. 
- A large amount of time is spent in common runtime libraries. 

Multiuser systems are commonly used to support the following types of user
environments: 

- Multiuser/shared system environment performing office automation, word
  processing, spreadsheet, email, database, payroll, and data processing. 
- Compute server environment that uses an extremely large quantity of data,
  performs large quantities of floating point calculations, and large amounts
  of Interprocess Communications (IPC) for graphics. 
- Large database environment with a lot of disk I/O, data in memory, and IPC
  via shared memory.
- File server environment with a heavy concentration of integer compute file
  system operations.
